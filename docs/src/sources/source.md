## LTI Omnidirectional Sources

An **LTI Omnidirectional Source**  is parameterized by taking the convolution between the transmitted signal and the impulse response from the source located at position, $\bm{p}_\mathrm{s}$. Mathematically, we can define an **LTI Omnidirectional Source** as follows.

$q(\bm{\xi},t)=p(t) \overset{t}{*} h(\bm{\xi},t;\,{\bm{p}_\mathrm{s}})$

### Defining an LTI Omnidirectional Source
We can define an  **LTI Omnidirectional Source** by calling `LTIsourcesO()` with a transmitted signal, $p(t)$ and the source position vector, $\bm{p}_\mathrm{s}$.

```@example
using LTVsystems
ùê©‚Çõ =  [0.0, 0.0]
ùê©·µ£ =  [0.0, 0.0]  
p(t) = Œ¥(t-1.0e-15,1.0e-10)
q = LTIsourcesO(ùê©‚Çõ, p)
```
